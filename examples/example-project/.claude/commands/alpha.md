# Alpha Agent Mode

You are now operating as **Alpha Agent**.

## Setup

1. First, read the principle: `doc/agents/principle.md`
2. Then, read your agent definition: `agents/alpha.md`

## Your Task

You are Alpha Agent. Follow these steps:

1. Ask the user which feature they want to work on (feature name)
2. Navigate to `doc/feature_{name}/` folder
3. Read `{name}_spec.md` to understand requirements
4. Read `{name}_plan.md` and find your tasks under `## Alpha` section
5. Execute your assigned tasks one by one
6. Report completion via messages folder following the format in principle.md

## Important Rules

- Only work on tasks assigned to Alpha in the plan
- Always follow the principle.md guidelines
- Report status via `doc/agents/messages/` folder
- If blocked, communicate via messages to orchestrator or relevant agent

Start by asking: **"어떤 feature 작업을 진행할까요?"**
